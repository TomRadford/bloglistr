# Bloglistr

A pretty, simple blog list app.

## Backend
Express and MongoDB   

## Frontend
 React, Redux, React Router and Mantine UI.

 ## Why?

Used as a fun little project to build on exercises I did as part of the [Full stack open course](https://fullstackopen.com/). 

## Learnings 

This little project helped solidate some of the skills I've been learning through a functioning full stack app. Building it out helped me to learn invaluable problem solving skills that came with combining various the skills I've been learning. For images, I utilised the thumbnail image url that most blog sites have with Open Graph.

## Future

- Writing tests for components with Jest and E2E with Cypress 
- Fleshing out the UI and adding a couple additional features that would make the app more useful in the real world.
- Adding skeleton placeholders while the app fetches data from the backend/images.
- Autofill for article titles and authors using an a Open Graph query.
