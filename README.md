## Backend

Express and MongoDB

## Frontend

React, Redux, React Router and Mantine UI.

## Why?

Used as a fun little project to build on exercises I did as part of the [Full stack open course](https://fullstackopen.com/).

## Learnings

This little project helped solidate some of the skills I've been learning through a functioning full stack app. Building it out helped me to learn invaluable problem solving skills that came with combining various the skills I've been learning. For images, I utilised the thumbnail image url that most blog sites have with Open Graph.

## Future

-   Writing tests for components with Jest and E2E with Cypress
-   Fleshing out the UI and adding a couple additional features that would make the app more useful in the real world.
-   Adding skeleton placeholders while the app fetches data from the backend/images.
-   Autofill for article titles and authors using an a Open Graph query.
